•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project essentially asked us to read items from an input file and check how many times that items shows up. After that we write the results to an output file. 



•	What did you do particularly well?

I feel like I cleaned up the main program really well as to improve readability and portability for the functions.




•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I used the vector container to store info but I felt that maps would have been a better and more efficient way to complete it. At the time I’ve just learned about maps but was more comfortable working with vectors as I already know them to be dynamically sized meaning they are convenient to use when you don’t know how many elements you are going to work with.


•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part for me was figuring out how I can add items to a vector while checking at the same time if they are already in the vector to avoid duplicate elements. This took me the longest to figure out, I had to learn of a new method which was the find() method. It helped check whether a variable was already and element in the vector. It seems simple now but at the time I had to step back and essentially plan out and think of a method that would work. Whenever I am stuck on a problem I plan out a method via pseudocode. Reviewing past projects and assignments gives me ideas as well.



•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I learned a lot from this project and it gave me a chance to experiment with the code a bit. Hopefully my main takeaway from this project is the skill to optimize my code as much as possible. It’s not perfect and I still have to work on it but I am hoping to take this skill and improve on it in future projects.



•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In an attempt to keep the program maintainable and adaptable I tried to keep every function outside of the main program unless it’s absolutely necessary or I’m calling the function. Since I only created one class I declared my variables as private. If in the future I want to create a subclass and inherit and change the class members’ privacy.
